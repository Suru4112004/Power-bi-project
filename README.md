Animal Bite Report - UK
This Power BI report provides a comprehensive analysis of animal bite incidents across the UK, focusing on vaccination data, quarantine periods, and bite patterns over time. The report leverages multiple interactive visuals to allow users to explore trends, vaccine data, and bite incidents across different regions and timeframes.
Frist i get the data of animal bites and then open power bi then go to the excel in the power bi and then i clean and transform the data.

Key Visuals & Insights:
Pie Chart - Sum of Vaccination Years and Sum of Victim ZIP Year:
This pie chart compares the total number of vaccination years and the total number of victim ZIP years. It helps users understand the distribution of vaccination and victim data across various years.
Filter for Bite Date:
A slicer/filter to select specific bite dates, allowing users to narrow down the dataset based on the timeframe of interest.
Donut Chart - Sum of Vaccination and Where Bitten by Year:
The donut chart visualizes the total number of vaccinations and the locations where the bites occurred across different years, offering insights into vaccination trends and geographic patterns over time.
Count of Quarantine Date by Year:
This visual shows the count of quarantine events by year. It helps track quarantine trends in response to animal bites, offering a better understanding of the necessary public health measures.
Gauge - Count of Animal Bites (12.05K):
The gauge chart displays the total number of animal bites reported (12,050) and gives users a quick view of bite incidents compared to predefined thresholds.
Q&A Visual - Average Vaccination Year (1.45):
Using Power BI’s Q&A feature, this visualization calculates the average vaccination year for animal bite cases, giving insight into how recent or older vaccination data is in relation to animal bite incidents.
Waterfall Chart - Count of Animal Bites by Year:
The waterfall chart illustrates the year-on-year changes in the count of animal bites. It highlights trends, increases, and decreases in bite incidents over time, offering valuable insights for public health analysis.
First Quarter Analysis:
A visual focused on data from the first quarter of the year, allowing users to drill down into seasonal variations in animal bite incidents.
Count of Animal Bites by Day, Year, Quarter, and Month:
Multiple time-based filters help display bite incidents by day, year, quarter, and month. This breakdown helps users to identify patterns in animal bite occurrences throughout the year and in different timeframes.
Data Source:
This report utilizes data on animal bites, including vaccination history, quarantine records, and bite incidents, sourced from UK public health datasets.

Purpose:
The goal of this report is to analyze the frequency and distribution of animal bites, understand the relationship between vaccination status and bite incidents, and track the effectiveness of quarantine measures across the UK.

Usage:
This Power BI report is designed for public health officials, researchers, and anyone interested in studying trends related to animal bites, vaccination, and quarantine efforts in the UK.

conclusion:
The Animal Bite Report - UK offers valuable insights into the trends and patterns of animal bite incidents, focusing on vaccination status, quarantine measures, and seasonal variations. By leveraging Power BI’s interactive visuals, the report helps identify key areas for public health intervention, track the effectiveness of vaccination and quarantine efforts, and understand how bite incidents vary over time and across regions. This analysis is a useful tool for public health professionals and policymakers to make data-driven decisions aimed at reducing animal bites and improving public health responses and this data will helpul for if India got this situation. 


Certainly! Here's a more concise version of the analysis:

Analysis
In my analysis If animal bites are increasing, it’s crucial to boost vaccination efforts for both humans and animals.
Human Vaccination: Increasing vaccinations for high-risk individuals (e.g., veterinarians, pet owners) can help prevent serious infections.
Animal Vaccination: Vaccinating animals, particularly those prone to biting, reduces the spread of zoonotic diseases and the likelihood of bites.
By enhancing vaccination programs, both for animals and humans, we can effectively reduce the number of animal bites and improve public health safety.
